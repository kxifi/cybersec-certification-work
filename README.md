## **Project Overview**

This project showcases an **Internal IT Audit** for a fictional mid-sized retailer, **Botium Toys**. The core objective was to assess the company's current security posture and controls against critical industry standards to provide **actionable recommendations** for immediate risk mitigation.  
The audit focused on evaluating the current state of **Administrative, Technical, and Physical controls** across the organization's assets, including employee devices, internal networks, and data storage.

## **The Core Problem: High-Risk Access & Data Security Gaps**

The audit identified a significant lack of critical preventative controls, resulting in a **High Risk** score for the organization. While the data integrity was currently maintained, the control gaps posed an immediate threat of compromise, leading to compliance failures across multiple frameworks.

### **Key High-Risk Findings:**

* **Universal Access:** All employees possess unauthorized, unrestricted access to sensitive data, including **Cardholder Data** and **PII/SPII**, violating the principle of Least Privilege.  
* **Missing Encryption:** Customer credit card information is accepted, processed, and stored **without encryption**, creating immediate non-compliance with PCI DSS and GDPR.  
* **Weak Password Policy:** The existing password policies are minimal and not consistently enforced, making unauthorized access through weak credentials highly likely.  
* **No Business Continuity:** Critical data is not subject to recurring backups, and **no Disaster Recovery Plan** is in place, threatening business continuity in the event of a breach or system malfunction.  
* **Absent Detection:** The lack of an **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** leaves the company blind to potential intrusions by threat actors on both physical and digital assets.

## **💡 Methodology and Compliance Frameworks**

The audit process adhered to a defense-in-depth strategy, mapping identified controls and risks to the following industry frameworks:

| Area of Focus | Framework | Audit Goal & Focus |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Security Posture** | **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)** | Used the **Identify** function to classify assets and provided controls across **Administrative, Technical, and Physical** domains. |
| **Payment Data** | **PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)** | Assessed the security environment for storing, processing, and transmitting customer credit card information. |
| **Data Privacy** | **GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)** | Verified adherence to standards for protecting EU citizens' PII/SPII, including data encryption and a required 72-hour breach notification process. |
| **Organizational Trust** | **SOC (System and Organization Controls)** | Evaluated controls related to Security, Confidentiality, and the crucial **Processing Integrity** of the data. |

## **Prioritized Remediation Plan (Top 5 Recommendations)**

The following high-priority, multi-domain control recommendations were proposed to stakeholders to drastically reduce risk and achieve cross-framework compliance:

1. **Least Privilege (Administrative Control):** Enforce strict role-based access to limit all employees to the **minimal set of permissions** required to perform their specific job duties.  
2. **Mandatory Encryption (Technical Control):** Immediately implement strong encryption for all stored, transmitted, and processed PII/SPII and Cardholder Data to satisfy GDPR and PCI DSS requirements.  
3. **Separation of Duties (Administrative Control):** Implement policy to segregate critical or conflicting tasks (e.g., payroll management and inventory) to prevent fraud, data tampering, and manipulation.  
4. **Intrusion Detection System (IDS) (Detective Control):** Deploy an IDS to monitor network traffic for anomalous behavior, providing rapid detection of potential intrusions.  
5. **Disaster Recovery Plan (Corrective Control):** Establish a full Disaster Recovery Plan and implement a robust, recurring backup schedule for all critical data to guarantee business continuity.
